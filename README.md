# Weather-Clother
A weather based clothes suggestion application.

This application uses a server in confluence with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch relevant local weather information and emails you the appropriate clothes to wear for the day automatically.

# Tech Stack

The application is predominantly written in JavaScript. It utilizes the Node JavaScript Runtime Environment, the Express.js framework and MongoDB to communicate with the client and for server operations.

# Developer Set Up

The application comes with the package.json file.
```javascript 
npm install

npm start
```
This is sufficient to download all production and development dependencies and to run the server.
